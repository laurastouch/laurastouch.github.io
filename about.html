				<p>Let me tell you a little about my story!
When I was young I travelled a lot with my parents, especially around the South of Italy and, thanks to my mom, I got to know ancient Roman art. It was at Piazza Armerina's Villa (Sicily) that I fell in love with art, ancient buildings and restoration. 
<br>
<br>
I was only eight years old, but I knew what my path would have been: I began my studies at the University of Venice and I graduated in Chemical Sciences for Conservation and Restoration. 
During my studies I developed a true passion for art, colours, beauty and harmony. Since childhood, I have always drawn and created handmade gifts for my parents and made every sort of artcrafts! 
<br>
<br>
But the real challenge was just about to come!
I couldn't find a job, neither in Italy or in the rest of the world! I accepted a rent-paying job as a secretary, but I could not get any satisfaction out of it... I was unhappy. After three long (long, long, long… ) years with such an unsatisfactory professional life, I was on the verge of a breakdown, only my DIY could provide an escape from the hopeless loop I dragged myself into.
<br>
<br>
And then: the breakthrough!
I left everithing I had, I moved from my hometown and from my comfort zone with a new aim in life: to follow my heart! I moved abroad with my boyfriend and started my own business, all about making my own creations: jewels, party favors and all sort of things!
<br>
<br>
And I can finally say this: today I’m very happy!
I have a new incredible life, a new home in Como, new friends and a whole world of exciting challenges!
